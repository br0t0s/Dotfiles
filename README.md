# What Are Dotfiles?
‚ú® Dotfiles are the customization files that are used to personalize your Linux or other Unix-based system. The period at the beginning of a filename or directory name indicates that it is a hidden file or directory.  This repository contains my personal dotfiles. They are stored here for convenience so that I may quickly access them on new machines or new installs.  Also, others may find some of my configurations helpful in customizing their own dotfiles. ‚ú®
